Joint inversion of Rayleigh wave fundamental and higher order mode phase velocity dispersion curves using Multi-Ojective Grey Wolf Optimiser.

You will need srfpython package (github.com/obsmax/srfpython) for forward modelling (generate dispersion curves) during the inversion process and swprocess package (pypi.org/project/swprocess/) to perform surface wave processing.

For detailed information on the project, please refer to:
