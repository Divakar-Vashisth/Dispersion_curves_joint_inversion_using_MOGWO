Joint Inversion of Rayleigh wave fundamental and higher order mode phase velocity dispersion curves was performed using Multi-Ojective Grey Wolf Optimiser.

You will need srfpython package(github.com/obsmax/srfpython) for forward modelling (generate dispersion curves) during the inversion process and swprocess package(pypi.org/project/swprocess/) to perform surface wave processing.
